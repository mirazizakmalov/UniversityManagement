# UniversityManagement
This project is a Java-based OOP application designed to manage university personnel efficiently.

The program organizes and stores information for three types of university members: Staff, Students, and Faculty. Each type of object includes specific attributes tailored to its role within the university but uses shared structures via polymorphism. 

Students: It keeps track of their university ID, name, and GPA.
Faculty: Includes details like their title (e.g., Professor, Lecturer) and department (e.g., Mathematics, Computer Science).
Staff: Stores work-related details specific to their role at the university.

The program uses abstract classes (or interfaces) to define common features for all types of university members while letting each type have its own special attributes. Itâ€™s all neatly wrapped up in a way that makes the code easy to read, modify, and maintain.
